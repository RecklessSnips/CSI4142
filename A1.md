**Insight method:** r7 
**Insight:** The housing price exhibited a steady increase from January to June 2016, followed by a sharp decline in July. It then rebounded rapidly, reaching 1 million in December 2016. However, the market experienced another notable decline over the next seven months, lasting until July 2017. Despite this downturn, the price surged once again, peaking at 1.2 million in August 2017.

**Grouping:** Grouping is done by setting a bound between 0-400, 400-1000, and 1000~max from the column Landsize. Then label them as Small, Medium, Large, to construct a new column named LandsizeGroup.

Between 2016 and 2017, Melbourne's housing prices experienced notable fluctuations. Most properties were priced between 85k and 3.085M, with houses being the most popular property type. Prices steadily increased from January to June 2016, peaking at nearly 1M before a sharp drop in July. By December 2016, prices rebounded to 1M but declined again over the next seven months, bottoming out in July 2017. Afterward, prices surged to a peak of 1.2M in August 2017. In Metropolitan areas, especially Southern Metropolitan, housing prices were higher and showed significant outliers due to luxury mansions, while Victoria regions exhibited lower prices and greater stability. The data highlights a dynamic market influenced by property type, land size, and location, with distinct contrasts between Metropolitan and Victoria regions.
